# CardWithImage Component
  
This is the text describing the `CardWithImage` component. It is written in MDX so you can use
Markdown for stuff like code snippets:
```html
<div>Yo!</div>
```

Then include your component story/stories by importing them as props inside the React `Canvas`
component. For instance, if you have a Story called `Foo` inside your story, and another
one called `Bar` inside it, you could write some stuff in markdown and then go get the 
whole story like this:
```jsx
<Canvas of={CardWithImageStories.Default} />

<Canvas of={CardWithImageStories.Bar} />
```

Which will then look like this:

<Canvas of={CardWithImageStories.Default} />

<Canvas of={CardWithImageStories.Bar} />
